**Welcome to our project**!

Team: Shravya Nallamilli, Brenda Org & Louise Smith

## Project folder structure

Explore and visualise data with Python! In this project, we load, clean, and analyse datasets, then create informative visualisations to uncover insights and trends hidden within the data. All the source code is located in the folder named `CFG-data-project`. This code can be run as a standard Jupyter notebook. The folder also contains graphs and data visualisations for three locations: London, Swansea, and Preston. Additionally, a precipitation graph is included to provide a clear visualisation of rainfall amounts.

## Steps for running the code

1. **Clone the git repo locally**:

2. **Install the necessary Libraries**:

 Necessary libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, and `matplotlib` are imported, and the `meteostat` package is used to fetch historical weather data.
   
   ```python
   !pip install meteostat
   import pandas as pd
   import numpy as np
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   from datetime import datetime
   from meteostat import Point, Monthly
```
Open `CFG-data-project` in jupyter notebook

Run the Code (It's that simple! üòä)
